## Assigment
The assignment consists of a scrapper of reddit posts and a RESTful server. Python script using the Beautiful Soup library to collect data from the site www.reddit.com by posts in the Top -> This Month category. The Assignment application saves the parser data not directly to a file, but through a separate RESTful service available on http://localhost:8087/, which in turn provides a simple API for working with basic file operations.
